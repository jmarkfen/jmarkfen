## Future ideas

create a python cli that does the following:
- allow the user to input an entry containing a short keyword with a long description
- allow the user to set the other entries as parents of an entry
- allow the user to add child entries to an entry
- generate a unique id for each entry
- allow the user to select an entry and automatically paste it to the clipboard with the option to choose between the id, keyword, or description
